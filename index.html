  <p style="font-family: serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: center; color: black;">
    A stand-alone Senior High School (SHS) is a secondary school that operates independently from a Junior High School (JHS) or Integrated School (IS). It has its own distinct location and a separate school head (principal). This contrasts with Integrated SHS, which is located within an existing JHS or IS and shares the same school head.<br><br>
    Essentially, a stand-alone Senior High School is a separate institution specifically dedicated to Grades 11 and 12, the final two years of the K to 12 program in the Philippines. It offers specialized upper secondary education based on the chosen tracks and strands.<br><br>
    Here's a breakdown:<br>
    <b>Stand-alone:</b> A Senior High School with its own campus and principal, separate from any other school.<br>
    <b>Integrated:</b> A Senior High School within an existing Junior High School or Integrated School, sharing the same principal.
